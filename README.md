## Projects

### Data Analysis & Insights (Crime Analysis)
- **Spatiotemporal Analysis:** Conducted analysis of crime patterns in DC using Python/R and geospatial tools (GeoPandas, Tableau) to identify peak crime hours, high-risk seasons, and geographic hotspots.
- **Crime Quantification:** Measured prevalence of crime types (e.g., theft, assault) and methods (e.g., firearms, physical force) to inform law enforcement resource allocation.
- **Spatial Clustering:** Mapped crime density across neighborhoods/wards to identify high-risk zones (e.g., Ward 2, Police District 1) contributing to 40%+ of incidents.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compared violent vs. property crimes, finding neighborhoods with 2x higher violent crime rates correlated with socioeconomic factors.

### Predictive Modeling & Strategy (Crime Trends)
- Engineered time-series forecasts (ARIMA, Prophet) to predict monthly crime incidents with 85% accuracy.
- Developed regression models isolating key predictors (e.g., shift timing, neighborhood demographics) to reveal a 25% higher likelihood of thefts during evenings.

### Bike Share Analysis
- **Objective:** Developed a predictive analytics solution to forecast bike rental demand using machine learning.
- Processed and cleaned the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset‚Äîaddressing missing values, redundancies, and multicollinearity.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) incorporating temporal, seasonal, and weather-based trends.
- Built and fine-tuned regression models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) achieving an R¬≤ score up to 0.93.
- Identified key influencing factors such as peak hours and weather conditions.
- Developed interactive visualizations and deployed a Streamlit dashboard for real-time analysis.
- Structured the codebase using object-oriented programming (OOP) for enhanced reusability and scalability.

### Clustering for Patient Data Analysis (EHR Clustering)
- **Objective:** Identify clusters in EHR data for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Heart Failure (HF) patients.
- Preprocessed high-dimensional EHR data using PCA and UMAP for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
- Applied clustering algorithms (K-Means and DBSCAN) to explore patient groupings.
- Determined optimal clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores.
- Fine-tuned UMAP hyperparameters to balance local and global data structures, producing clear visualizations of distinct subgroup separations.

### Heart Disease Prediction
- **Objective:** Develop a machine learning web application to predict heart disease risk in real time.
- Created a robust data preprocessing pipeline (using Pipeline and ColumnTransformer) for tasks such as categorical encoding, missing value imputation, and feature scaling.
- Built a logistic regression model achieving approximately 84% accuracy.
- Developed an interactive Streamlit web app that allows users to input data and view dynamic predictions and visualizations (including feature importance plots and Plotly radar charts).
- Serialized the trained pipeline using Pickle for reproducibility and future deployment.

### Predictive Modeling for Targeted Marketing
- **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to predict a customer‚Äôs likelihood of purchasing a target book.
- Conducted comprehensive EDA including correlation analysis and visualization of feature distributions.
- Performed statistical tests (T-tests, Chi-Square) to identify significant predictors of customer behavior.
- Applied preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE for class imbalance and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Benchmarked models (K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest), selecting KNN for its superior accuracy (90.6%).
- Optimized hyperparameters and evaluated models using metrics like AUC, precision, and recall.
- Enhanced model interpretability through SHAP analysis to understand feature contributions.

### Predictive Fitness Analytics (Team of 2)
- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model for sports classification (running vs. biking) based on fitness data.
- Developed a machine learning model to classify sports activities using fitness data.
